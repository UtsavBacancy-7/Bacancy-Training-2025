![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54604bfd-ac71-4862-9560-18d2bc330257)
- Write LINQ Queries(Using Method & Query syntax) to Solve the Following:
  - List all books and their corresponding borrow records, even if a book has never been borrowed.
  - Generate a dataset that pairs each book with every borrow record, regardless of any existing relationship.
  - Modify the first query so that all books appear, even if no one has borrowed them.
  - Retrieve a list of books that have been borrowed, displaying each bookâ€™s title along with the name of the borrower. Books that have never been borrowed should not appear in the output.
  - Categorize all borrow records by book title, displaying the total number of times each book has been borrowed.
  - Solve this using two different approaches and compare the results.
  - List all books that have been borrowed at least 3 times, using a nested LINQ query.
  - Retrieve a list of unique genres available in the book collection.
  - Combine two book collections (from different libraries), ensuring there are no duplicate books.
  - Identify books that appear in both collections.
  - Find books that exist in one collection but not in the other.
  - Construct a LINQ query to fetch book titles but delay execution until later.Modify the dataset before execution and observe how it impacts results.
  - Convert the query to execute immediately and compare the differences.
  - Create a query which uses eager loading to display related data.
